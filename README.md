# Spam Classifier
This  ML model classifies Email or SMS into Spam or Not Spam.
- The model has 98 % accuracy rate.
- The model is trained on Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB) algorithm.
   The Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB) algorithm is a specific variant of the Naive Bayes classifier that is commonly used for binary classification problems,
   where the goal is to categorize data into one of two classes, typically represented as 0 and 1.
- The model is integrated with Web App using Streamlit.
- Streamlit Cloud is used for model deployment.
